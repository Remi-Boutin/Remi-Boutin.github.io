I am a third year PhD student at the [MAP 5 laboratory](https://map5.mi.parisdescartes.fr), 
 [Université Paris Cité](https://u-paris.fr/), 
under the supervision of [Pr. Pierre Latouche](https://lmbp.uca.fr/~latouche/)
and [Pr. Charles Bouveyron](https://math.univ-cotedazur.fr/~cbouveyr/). 
My areas of research are related to *statistical network analysis*,
*topic modelling* as well as *deep probabilistic modelling*. Feel free to send me an email for more information concerning my work.
