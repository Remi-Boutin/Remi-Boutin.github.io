I hold a postdoc position at the LPSM laboratory, Sorbonne Université, 
under the supervision of senior research scientist [Catherine Mathis](http://cmatias.perso.math.cnrs.fr/).
My work focuses on node clustering in sparse hypergraphs.

I obained my PhD in 2023 at the [MAP 5 laboratory](https://map5.mi.parisdescartes.fr), 
 [Université Paris Cité](https://u-paris.fr/), for my thesis on _Deep graphical models and inference strategies for the analysis of networks comprising textual edges_
under the supervision of [Pr. Pierre Latouche](https://lmbp.uca.fr/~latouche/)
and [Pr. Charles Bouveyron](https://math.univ-cotedazur.fr/~cbouveyr/). 

My areas of research are related to *statistical network analysis*, *network clustering*,
*topic modelling* as well as *deep probabilistic modelling*. Feel free to send me an email for more information concerning my work.
